# FIXED: File Corruption Issue

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE ENCOUNTERED
When creating files with multiple `append` operations, the files were corrupted - only the last appended section was saved, missing the beginning of the files.

## ‚úÖ FIXED FILES
1. `/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Complete login component restored
2. `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Complete AuthProvider and useAuth exports restored

## üö® LESSON LEARNED
Always use `write_file` with mode `rewrite` for complete files. Avoid using multiple `append` operations for React components - it can cause file corruption.

## üåê SERVER STATUS
- Now running on: **http://localhost:3008**
- Login page should work correctly
- Authentication system functional
